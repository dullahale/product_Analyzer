This a simple Python Project that involves data manipulation. In this project, I am
going to create a program that reads data from a CSV file (I created), performs some
basic data manipulation, and then writes the result back to a new CSV file. But this process
of data manipulation is going to be automated.

To run this code you need to open the product_Analyzer.py on pycharm also make sure
the Products.csv file is in the same working directory as the python file. Hence from there follow
the instruction on the TODO in the product_Analyer.py file.

When suceesfully run the code should return 4 new CSV files which will all contain the modified data in them.
